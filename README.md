## Description

This application is my first full stack development project. The Tech Blog is where developers can publish blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. I had to code the API routes, database, table models, user functionality, user sessions, and page templates. This taught me a lot about managing data, users, and dynamic web pages.

## Usage
When first visiting the site, you will see existing posts and a few options along the navigation bar. Anybody is able to view individual posts along with their comments but you must be logged in to submit a comment. You must also be logged in to publish, edit, or delete a post of your own. Simply login or sign up to access all the functionality. Click on the image below to visit the deployed application.
